# openSUSE-Theme
Using the Breeze Dark theme and the openSUSEdarkalternate theme, combined the accenting to make a Breeze Dark with openSUSE green highlights. This will match the openSUSE dark workspace theme
Created a GTK2/3 theme that matches the openSUSE Breeze Dark so GTK apps will have the same coloring.

The GTK2/3 theme is largely unneeded at this point as the newer Plasma theme integration wtih GTK has replaced the need for this.
