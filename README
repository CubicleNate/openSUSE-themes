This is my working folder for creating an openSUSE Breeze Dark theme for the Qt and GTK2/3 toolkits. Currently, the Qt Scheme is ready, GTK3 is also ready, mostly, my only issue now is the GTK2 theme which requires further tweaking. It's too blocky and flat. I have been using Oomox to create the theme but it seems that the GTK2 theme doesn't quite match my GTK3 settings. More work is required and any input is welcome.`

Note, the GTK2/3 is largely not necessary and is only staying here for historical purposes. The newer methods of theme integration of GTK themes in to Plasma make this largely uncecessary.
